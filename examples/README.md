# Aether Examples

This directory contains some mission specific bots that comes under Project Aether. These bots are mainly made for 
testing out some functionality.

The bots here may be created for experimentation and can also come in the main bot i.e. `aether-core`.

## Bots Available

    blocks. This bot is on Minecraft Version `1.20.6`.
2. [**Anti-AFK**](./anti-afk) - This bot joins the server and does some actions to not get AFK Kicked and
    also supports auto eat functionality.

_More bots will be coming soon._
