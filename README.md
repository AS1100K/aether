# Aether
Minecraft Bots written in rust mainly developed for 2b2t.

This repository currently supports minecraft version `1.20.6` and uses self-maintained version of [azalea better-1.20.6](https://github.com/as1100k-forks/azalea.git)
which has more features and fixes.

There is `mc-1.21` branch which directly uses [azalea](https://github.com/azalea-rs/azalea.git) but is not mainly
worked on. Once, `azalea-viaversion` will work or `2b2t.org` will directly support `1.21` then this repository will
be completely migrated to `1.21`.
